# LAB-Homework 5
##### Given a graph with weighted edges as indicated by the numbers in parentheses, please provide a program that accomplishes the following tasks:
* Implement the single-source shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra) to calculate and print the distance from a specified source vertex to every other vertex in the graph.
* Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal on the graph.

*S V1 3;* : (connection start point connection end point connection weight);

<PS>This connection diagram is the relationship of input1, and the rest of the test cases are not necessarily the same as this.
The output must show the path and total weight of the shortest path.
